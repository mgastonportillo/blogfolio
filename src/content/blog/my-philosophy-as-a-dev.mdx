Developers are odd creatures. We tend to think that our worth is in the quality of our code, in our ability to regurgitate knowledge, or my favourite new trend, in the diversity of our toolbelt -- because technology is fast but we are faster. **Watch out new framework that is 10X harder, better, faster, stronger; we'll <em>vore you</em>**. And then the next one. And the next one. And the next one too.

As part of the keyboard-tapper species, I'm guilty of some of these sins. But that is fine, since acknowledging our flaws is the only way to grow up and become a better version of ourselves, as a person and as a professional.

## A wall-headbutting backstory
Not so long ago I was obsessing over planning my immersion into the world of Rust or Go -- the next "future-proof" step beyond JavaScript and Python. I felt this urge to leave these "slow" and "inefficient" languages behind, as soon as possible. Which, in hindsight, is really funny considering I lack real industry experience with any of them...

## La verdad de la milanesa*
<Highlight type="star" color="blue" aria-labelledby="la-verdad-de-la-milanesa">
**Turns out I didn't know JavaScript as well as I thought.** Confronting this truth was humbling and sparked a huge shift in my approach.
</Highlight>

One day, I discovered <Link href="https://justjavascript.com/">Just JavaScript</Link>, an online course proposing a mental model to effectively "think in JavaScript". This marked a turning point. The course challenged my assumptions about what good frontend development even was -- it's UI was simple yet elegant and its content was impactful and exposed gaps in my knowledge. It was earth-shattering. I was bleeding out through this open wound, but like they say back home: "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger", and I was going to experience it in my own skin.

In the past, I directed my learning towards 3D and animation libraries in order to create seemingly engaging visual experiences, but I was neglecting foundations that **truly serve the user**, like accessibility and intuitive design. This realisation, along with insights from courses like <Link href="https://www.joyofreact.com/">The Joy of React</Link> (which highlighted the importance of accessibility) and principles like those of <Link href="https://calmtech.com/">Calm Technology</Link>, became the catalyst for the kind of developer I want to become.

## Master of my craft... well, something like that
I plan to be a JavaScript samurai, embracing all the stigmas that come with it. JavaScript is my chosen tool and I've surrounded myself with powerful extensions: TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node, and Bun -- just to name a few.

But mastery goes beyond technical prowess. Just as the samurai sought balance of body and mind, I see CSS and HTML as crucial for equilibrium in the realm of web development. That's why I'm building a solid understanding of CSS, expanding it with knowledge in <Link href="https://sass-lang.org/">SASS/SCSS</Link> and <Link href="https://styled-components.com/">Styled Components</Link>.

<Highlight type="info">
Maybe some day I could write about why I'm not a fan of Tailwind, the current industry standard, although I reckon its features and contributions.
</Highlight>

Regarding HTML, right now I am learning <Link href="https://astro.build/">Astro</Link> in order to get closer to the "skeleton" of the web. I'm also constantly learning about accessibility features, like those provided by <Link href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">ARIA</Link>, which powers HTML up.

## Final thoughts

This philosophy extends beyond technology. I want to be a great web developer and an even better human being. I strive to create work that respects its users, that  prioritizes their needs over simply imposing my own preferences. This means embracing the ongoing fight against digital clutter as well.

What about you? Why have you read up to this point? Is there anything you can reflect on from what I've written here? If so, I hope this small corner in the web had contributed to your own journey, directly or indirectly. This focus on user-centered, accessible and efficient experiences with just a bit touch of magic is the kind of web I want to be a part of building. A web that's delightful yet simple, inclusive, and respectful of our time and attention.
