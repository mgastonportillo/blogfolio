Web developers... well, developers in general are a quirky bunch. We tend to think that our worth is in the quality of our code, in our ability to regurgitate knowledge, or my favourite new trend, in the diversity of our toolbelt -- because technology is fast but we are faster. **Watch out new framework that is 10X harder, better, faster, stronger; we'll <i>hold you tight!</i>**. And then the next one. And the next one. And the next one too.

As part of the keyboard-tapper species, I'm guilty of some of these sins. But that is fine, since acknowledging our flaws is the only way to grow up and become a better version of ourselves, as a person and as a professional.

## A wall-headbutting backstory
Not so long ago I was eagerly anticipating my deep dive into the world of Rust or Go -- my next "future-proof" step beyond JavaScript and Python. The latter weren't typed, they had <i>reeeally</i> weird behaviours and were consistently being mocked by "devs with experience" all over the internet. This negativity fueled an urge to abandon these "slow" and "inefficient" languages as soon as possible.

What an L take! What a terrible, ignorant take! I'm so glad that's not my point of view anymore. And to top it off, looking back, this is hilarious considering I lacked real-world experience with any of these languages...

## La verdad de la milanesa*
<Highlight type="star" color="blue" aria-labelledby="la-verdad-de-la-milanesa">
**Turns out I didn't even know JavaScript as well as I thought.** Confronting this truth was humbling and sparked a huge shift in my approach.
</Highlight>

One day, I discovered <Link href="https://justjavascript.com/">Just JavaScript</Link><GluedComma /> an online course proposing a mental model to effectively "think in JavaScript". This course challenged my assumptions about what good frontend development even was -- its UI was simple yet elegant, and its content was impactful and exposed gaps in my knowledge.

But then, what's the purpose of all those flashy libraries I'd been chasing?

In the past, I directed my learning towards 3D and animation libraries, seeking to create seemingly engaging visuals. But I was neglecting principles that <i>positively</i> impact the user, like accessibility and intuitive design. This realisation, along with insights from courses like <Link href="https://www.joyofreact.com/">The Joy of React</Link> (which highlighted the importance of accessibility) and proposals like those of <Link href="https://calmtech.com/">Calm Technology</Link><GluedComma /> became the catalyst for the kind of developer I want to become.

## Master of my craft... well, something like that
Today, I strive to embody the spirit of a web dev samurai. JavaScript is my weapon of choice, honed sharp with extensions like <Link href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</Link><GluedComma /> <Link href="https://react.dev/">React</Link><GluedComma /> <Link href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</Link><GluedComma /> <Link href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</Link><GluedComma /> <Link href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</Link> and <Link href="https://bun.sh/">Bun</Link>.

Albeit, just like samurai also sought balance of body and mind to achieve their mastery, I reckon that CSS and HTML are crucial for equilibrium in the realm of web development. That's why I'm building <Link href="https://css-for-js.dev/">a solid understanding of CSS</Link> and expanding it with knowledge in <Link href="https://sass-lang.org/">SASS/SCSS</Link> and <Link href="https://styled-components.com/">Styled Components</Link>.

<br />
<Highlight type="info">
I choose not to use Tailwind in my personal projects, although I recognise its contributions and acknowledge its features, because I prefer a close approach to pure CSS. That said, I am more than willing to use any industry standard in a team project.
</Highlight>

Right now, I am learning <Link href="https://astro.build/">Astro</Link> in order to get closer to the "skeleton" of the web,  but mainly because it's a lovely framework. I'm also lectured in <Link href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">ARIA</Link><GluedComma /> relevant for accesibility features in HTML.

On top of that, I'm driven by a deep curiosity about how the web works behind the scenes. I do so by delving into technologies like <Link href="https://www.boot.dev/learn/learn-http">HTTP, DNS</Link><GluedComma /> <Link href="https://devdoc.net/web/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started.html">AJAX</Link> and <Link href="https://git-scm.com/doc">Git(Hub)</Link><GluedComma /> among others.

## Final thoughts

This philosophy extends beyond technology. I want to be a great web developer but an even better human being. I am committed to create products that respect their users, that  prioritise their needs over simply imposing my own preferences. This means embracing the ongoing fight against digital clutter as well.

What about you? What inspired you to read up to this point? In any case, I hope this small corner in the web had contributed to your own journey, directly or indirectly. This focus on user-centered, accessible and efficient experiences with just a bit touch of magic is the kind of web I want to be a part of building. A web that's delightful yet simple, inclusive, and respectful of our time and attention.
