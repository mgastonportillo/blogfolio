Developers are odd creatures. We tend to think that our worth is in the quality of our code, in our ability to regurgitate knowledge or, my favourite, in the diversity of our toolbelt, because technology is fast but we are faster. **Watch out new framework that is 10X harder, better, faster, stronger; we'll vore you**.

As part of the keyboard-tapper species, I'm guilty of some of these sins. But that is fine, since acknowledging our flaws is the only way to grow up and become a better version of ourselves, as a person and as a professional.

## A wall-headbutting backstory
Not so long ago I was obsessed about learning Rust or Go -- the next "future-proof" step beyond JavaScript and Python. I felt this urge to leave these "slow" and "inefficient" languages behind. Which, in hindsight, is really funny considering I lack real industry experience with any of them...

## La verdad de la milanesa
<Highlight style="blue">
Turns out I didn't know JavaScript as well as I thought. Confronting this truth was humbling and sparked a huge shift in my approach.
</Highlight>


One day, I discovered <Link href="https://justjavascript.com/">Just JavaScript</Link>, a course proposing a mental model to effectively "think in JavaScript". And it was earth-shattering -- its UI was simple yet elegant, its content was impactful and exposed gaps in my knowledge. I was bleeding out through this open wound, but like they say back home: "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger", and I was going to experience it in my own skin.

This marked a turning point. The course challenged my assumptions about what good frontend development even was. For example, I was directing my learning towards 3D and animation libraries in order to create seemingly engaging visual experiences while neglecting the core principles that **truly serve the user**: accessibility, intuitive design, a commitment to combating digital clutter, etc. This realisation, along with insights from courses like <Link href="https://www.joyofreact.com/">The Joy of React</Link> (which subtly highlighted the importance of accessibility), became the catalyst for the kind of developer I want to become.
